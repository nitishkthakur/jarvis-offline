Right now, only Plus and Enterprise users can access and use the newest version of ChatGPT. [...] The public rollout began in July 2025. Sam Altman confirmed in interviews that GPT-5 had completed training earlier in the year. From mid-July, OpenAI started moving users of GPT-4 to the new model. This wasn’t marketed as a separate model toggle. Instead, OpenAI quietly bundled the upgrade into its existing GPT-4 setting. So when users select GPT-4 in ChatGPT, they are now running GPT-5 behind the scenes.\n",

The V60 highlights the complexity, character and balance of a coffee so certain coffees lend themselves to this and provide extremely quality brews. Our advice is to use light to medium roasted coffees that have undergone wet processing (aka washed coffees) with your V60, as they tend to feature cleaner, brighter levels of acidity and lighter body and texture. [...] Generally, we recommend a V60 coffee to water ratio of: 6-8g coffee per 100g water (1ml water = 1g water) Depending on the V60 Dripper size, this should equate to a brew time of 1-3 minutes for 1 cup, or 3-4 minutes for 2 cups.
