To have a better understanding of this new language model, we provide an in-depth guide focusing on its use, training, features, and limitations: ## GPT-4 vs. GPT-5 [...] The core of GPT-5 still relies on the Transformer model introduced by Vaswani et al. (2017), but now operates as a multi-model system. Instead of a single large model handling every request, GPT-5 includes several specialized variants such as gpt-5, gpt-5-mini, gpt-5-thinking, and gpt-5-nano with a real-time router deciding which one to use based on prompt complexity and desired speed. #### 1.1 Self-Attention Mechanism #### 1.2 Layers and Depth ### 2.

Altman decided to let GPT-5 take a stab at a question he didn’t understand. “I put it in the model, this is GPT-5, and it answered it perfectly,” Altman said. He described it as a “here it is moment,” adding that he “felt useless relative to the AI” because he felt like he should have been able to answer the question [...] GPT-5 had already been spotted in the wild before Altman’s appearance on This Past Weekend, fueling speculation that the next-generation GPT model was imminent.
